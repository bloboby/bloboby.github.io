# NERTS

### Standard terminology

- NERTS pile - the 13 cards that you need to get rid of in order to
  call NERTS
- holding area - your personal hetero columns
- shared piles - A to K by suit
- tab deck - the pile that you scroll through 3 at a time by pressing
  tab

### Additional terminology

- n - the number of columns in your holding area
- free column - a personal column that has no cards in it
- exposed card - a card that you can currently move
- hidden card - a card in your holding area that cannot be currently
  moved

## Strategy summary

After some experimentation I have settled on the following strategy:
1. Don't keep a free column, unless performing a temporary manouevre.
2. Build around n/2 full personal columns of opposite parity.
3. The other columns are for intermediate storage and ALL of their
   cards should be imminently playable into the shared piles.
4. Don't move cards out of tab deck unless it helps with either (2) or
   (3).

Here are some more situational techniques:
- Build personal columns in the direction that would facilitate two
  columns being merged.
- Sometimes you may need to build more full columns, such as an
  unlucky situation where you start off with two Kings of the same
  colour.
- Temporarily keep a free column to enable access to hidden cards.
  Possible operations include:
  - Putting high cards at the top a column,
  - Extracting a card from the middle of the column, and replacing it
    with its same-coloured counterpart. \*\*Warning\*\* if the
    counterpart is the current tab deck card, you will be locked out
    of it if someone else calls NERTS.

## Detailed explanation

NERTS cards must end up either in your holding area or in a shared
pile. Therefore, consider strategies that lie somewhere on the
following scale:

<pre>
Holding-area-focused < - - - - - - - - - > Shared-pile-focused
                                 ^     ^
                                 |     |
                                 2p    6p
</pre>

My strategy is a mix of the two, with tweaks based on the number of
players as indicated by the arrows above. It leans towards the
shared-pile focus, because I feel that the benefit of always having an
extra exposed card generally outweighs the benefit of having a
permanent free pile.

### Shared-pile-focused ideas

These ideas focus on playing as many cards into the shared piles as
possible.

- Play cards into a shared pile whenever reasonable and use the
  holding area only as an intermediate storage space.
- Always play the next NERTS card into any free columns, to maximise
  the number of exposed cards.
- Only move cards from the tab deck into your holding area if there is
  a good reason to do so.

This style is good when there are many players, few personal columns,
and the shared piles move quickly. It typically leads to a higher
score that is correlated with the overall shared pile progress. This
means that even if you don't call NERTS first, you typically will have
scored a similar number of points to everyone else who is using this
strategy.

### Holding-area-focused ideas

These ideas focus on building a full holding area that can accommodate
as many cards as possible.

- Always keep a free pile handy. This is crucial as it enables access
  to hidden cards.
- All the other columns should be as full as possible, with the goal
  of being able to accommodate more NERTS cards.
- Move cards into the holding area whenever possible, as long as there
  is still a free pile after the operation.

This style is good when there are few players, many personal columns,
and the shared piles move slowly. It typically leads to a low-scoring
NERTS that can be achieved independently of others' play. The
independence means that you could be very ahead of everyone else, or
very behind depending on your luck.
