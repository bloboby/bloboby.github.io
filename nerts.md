# NERTS

I am currently obsessed with NERTS.

### Standard terminology

- NERTS pile - the 13 cards that you need to get rid of in order to
  call NERTS
- tableau - your personal hetero columns
- foundations - the shared piles, A to K by suit
- stock pile - the pile that you scroll through 3 at a time

### Additional terminology

- n - the number of columns in your tableau
- to play, playable - putting a card into the foundation, a card that
  can be put into the foundation
- free pile - a tableau column that has no cards in it
- exposed card - a tableau card that is at the bottom of its column
  and can be freely moved
- hidden card - a tableau card that is not exposed and cannot be
  accessed directly

## Meta strategy

Since NERTS cards end up either in your tableau or in foundations,
consider strategies that lie somewhere on the following scale:

Tableau-focused < - - - - - - - - - - - > Foundation-focused

### Tableau-focused strategy

At its most extreme, this strategy would involve:
- Building n-1 full tableau columns, to accommodate as many NERTS
  cards as possible
- Always keeping a free pile handy,
- Moving cards from the stock into the tableau whenever possible, as
  long as there is still a free pile after the operation.

This style is good when there are few players, many tableau piles,
incentives to call NERTS, foundation moves slowly. It ideally leads to
a low-scoring NERTS that can be achieved independently of others'
play. The independence means that you could be very ahead of everyone
else, or you could be very behind, depending on your luck.

### Foundation-focused strategy

This would involve:
- Playing cards into the middle whenever possible and using the
  tableau only as an intermediate storage space,
- Always playing the next NERTS card into any free piles,
- Only moving cards from stock to tableau if there is a good reason to
  do so.

This style is good when there are many players, few tableau piles, no
incentive to call NERTS, foundation moves quickly. It typically leads
to a higher score that is correlated with the foundation's progress.
This means that even if you don't call NERTS first, you typically will
have scored a similar number of points to everyone else who is using
this strategy.

### Mixed strategy

This is harder to define, so here are some examples:
- Building only 1 or 2 full tableau columns, and using the other
  columns as intermediate storage,
- Only building tableau columns in the direction that would facilitate
  two columns being merged,
- Keeping a free pile for only a limited amount of time (e.g. until
  after you have played a hidden tableau card).

An ideal strategy is a mix that adapts to the current meta conditions.
